# You Don't Need to Choose a Lane

You know that question. The one adults have been asking since you were five. "So, are you a *science* person, or an *art* person?"

We're taught to pick a box. The analytical-minded go left, the creatives go right.

I just think it's a bad question.

My world is deeply technical. I’m spending my time figuring out how to get *Botryococcus Braunii* to produce more oil. It's all IB Chemistry, Biology, and lab protocols.

But my supervisors will also tell you I'm talented in the visual arts.

For a long time, these felt like two separate lives. One was "serious" (science) and one was "hobby" (art). This is, honestly, a pretty boring way to think.

During my internship at Cento, one of the first comments I got was about my "intentional notes by hand" and "natural perceptiveness of... social dynamics."

That's not a chemistry skill. That's an artist's skill.

**Art is just the practice of radical observation.**

You don't just *look*. You have to *see*. You see the negative space, the subtle shifts in color, the composition, the relationships between the objects.

Turns out, that's also the #1 skill in a VC's office. You're not just listening to the pitch; you're observing the dynamics in the room.

It's also the #1 skill in a lab. You're not just running the protocol; you're *noticing* the tiny, unexpected change in the culture.

My art background isn't a distraction from my science-and-tech focus. It's my main advantage. It’s what lets me take a complex research assignment and present the findings with clarity.

You can't explain what you haven't truly seen.
